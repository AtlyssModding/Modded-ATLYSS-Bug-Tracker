# Modded ATLYSS Bug Tracker
Go to the [Wiki page](https://github.com/kittycatto1/ZeinaKC-ATLYSS-Modded-Bug-Tracker/wiki/ATLYSS-Bug-Tracker) for the tracker itself. For vanilla bugs, use the [Steam Forums](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2768430/discussions/3/).\
Version-maintained bug tracker for modded ATLYSS with the goal of having easy access to troubleshooting information and keeping track of bugs across updates. Most of the reports are gathered through group contribution or personal findings.

This isn't directly related to the mod authors and isn't the place to report bugs to get them resolved. Join the [Atlyss Modding Central](https://discord.gg/hQceRJ7pEW) Discord server to get help with troubleshooting instead. Use the issues page to help report things to the tracker with [**troubleshooting standard**](https://github.com/AtlyssModding/ATLYSS-Modding-Resources/wiki/Troubleshooting-Standard).

ZeinaKC's personal wishes: I'll be maintaining this for as long as my interest remains or until I get hit by a bus. Anyone is free to contribute to help make this a useful resource, I have imported this to the Atlyss Modding Community and licensed it under CC BY-NC-SA to ideally avoid not require having duplicate repositories. Unless issues occur, it should hopefully remain here.

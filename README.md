# ZeinaKC's ATLYSS Modded Bug Tracker (UNOFFICIAL)
Go to the [Wiki page](https://github.com/kittycatto1/ZeinaKC-ATLYSS-Modded-Bug-Tracker/wiki/ATLYSS-Bug-Tracker) for the tracker itself. For vanilla bugs, use the [Steam Forums](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2768430/discussions/3/).\
Personally maintained bug tracker for modded ATLYSS with the goal of having easy access to troubleshooting information, keeping track of bugs, and miscellaneous things I put here for myself. Most of the reports are gathered through group contribution and efforts on my [Modpacks](https://thunderstore.io/c/atlyss/p/ZeinaKC/?section=bundles).

This isn't directly related to the mod authors (hence unofficial) and isn't the place to report bugs to get them resolved. Join the [Atlyss Modding Central Discord Server](https://discord.gg/hQceRJ7pEW) to get help with troubleshooting instead. Use the issues page to help report things to the tracker with the usual troubleshooting standard.
